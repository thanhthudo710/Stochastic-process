\chapter{Conclusion}
This report provided a gentle introduction for Hawkes process. In chapter 2, we covered the key definitions such as point process, counting process, non-homogeneous Poisson process, intensity function and its properties which providing some basic knowledge about Hawkes process. In chapter 3, we introduced the definitions of Hawkes process and Hawkes conditional intensity function including Intensity-based Hawkes Process model and Cluster-based Hawkes Process model, some algorithms, examples and Matlab\textsuperscript \textregistered simulation have been also given. The goal of the above materials is to provide the fundamentals to researchers who are interested in formulating and solving application problems. So we introduced some practical applications in final chapter, it includes insurance company model and crime data for specific area.
